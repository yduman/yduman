I'm a full-stack engineer based in Germany. I love programming, a good coffee and collect dozens of mechanical keyboards. I work with a variety of technologies, but recently trying to stick with TypeScript. Besides my studies, I develop cool things [@MaibornWolff](https://www.maibornwolff.de/), a lovely company with great people!
